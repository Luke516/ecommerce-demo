BUILDING SIGNS. Assist your customers and patrons when visiting your property with an Alpine Industries Building Sign. Using bold text – and most containing graphics – each sign provides clear identification for even those who may have trouble reading.

</span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item">
GREAT COLOR CONTRAST. Furnished with white lettering and graphics against a black background or red lettering against a white background, people can easily see and read this sign from across the room or down the hallway.

</span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item">
DURABLE CONSTRUCTION. Built to provide long-term use, each building sign is expertly crafted out of durable ABS plastic. Resistant to chemicals, heat and impact, this material is also easy to clean with a damp cloth when the need arises.

</span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item">
EASY HANGING. You can easily mount the Alpine Industries sign onto any wall or door. The lightweight sign comes with an included self-adhesive backing, making transport and placement easy for any business owner.

</span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item">
PERFECT SIZE. The bold text clearly conveys the sign’s message, while the 3” x 9” size takes up minimal space on doorways and walls. As such, these building signs are the perfect complements to any business space.
