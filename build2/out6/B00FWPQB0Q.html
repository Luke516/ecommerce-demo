CREATE THE IDEAL WOOD HUMIDOR with the global leader in 2-way humidity control—The mess-free way to condition a wood humidor before you add cigars and Boveda patented humidity control to restore and/or maintain premium cigars to a precise Relative Humidity (RH)

</span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item">
WHY SEASON—Boveda provides moisture directly to the cellular structure of a wood humidor to create a better seal and prevent the wood from stealing moisture from your premium cigars

</span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item">
SEASON EASILY—Just place the Boveda 84% RH in an EMPTY humidor for two (2) weeks. Toss Boveda Seasoning away when you’re done (Boveda isn't reusable) and replace with desired Boveda RH

</span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item">
USE THE RIGHT AMOUNT—Use one (1) Size 60 Boveda for every 25 TOTAL cigars a humidor can hold. Example: For a 100-cigar capacity humidor, use four (4) Size 60 Boveda at once. Seasoning a smaller humidor? Use fewer Boveda

</span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item">
RESEALABLE high-barrier plastic bag is factory sealed. Keep the zipper closed and you can expect these unwrapped Boveda to stay fresh for up to 2 years before you're ready to put them to use
