[Front &amp; Inside Parking Monitor] You need to purchase a hardwire kit with low battery voltage detection to leave it running when parked (not included). Signature low-profile design allows the dash cam to be a well-hidden witness to the road ahead. Both cameras can be rotated 180 degrees forward and backward, 50 degrees left and right.

[G-sensor&amp;Auto Incident Detection] The D30 dash cam will automatically lock the current recording video as a proof of an incident once the built-in G-sensor detects a collision. The locked files will NOT be overwritten by Loop Recording.

</span></li>

[SEAMLESS LOOP RECORDING] Loop Recording allows continuous use by writing over old, unneeded footage for efficient storage management. The installation is simple and convenient. The dash cam works automatically, it starts recording when the engine is turned on and stops when it is turned off.
