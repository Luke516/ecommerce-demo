DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS: Our 1 1/16-inch (27mm) Pitman Arm Puller is designed to handle the toughest Pitman arm pulling jobs on compact passenger cars. The yoke features drop forged construction and is heat treated for strength and durability, while the jaws are shaped to ensure a positive grip, which leaves your hands free for the pulling job.
