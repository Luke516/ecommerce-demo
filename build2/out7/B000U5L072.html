GREAT FOR ALL LUGGAGE: Our luggage locks are easy to read and easy to set. They are Travel Sentry Approved, so airport security will not use the bolt cutters to inspect your bags, and they are strong enough that you’ll have nothing to worry about while out exploring new places. They are perfect for locking backpacks, office desks, briefcases and instrument cases, too

<li><span class="a-list-item">
SET AND RESET OVER AND OVER: You can keep changing your combination on this Combination Luggage Lock as many times as you want. Use words like SOON, PACK, TRIP, and more to keep your luggage secure. If you want something a little trickier, you can mix up letter and make abbreviations or initials. Try tons of words with this easy to reset lock

</span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item">
EASY TO SET, NEVER FORGET: WordLock maintains the highest standard of security for personal and commercial locks, without using any keys or arbitrary number combinations.
