The Original Squatty Potty - Made in U.S.A. As seen on Shark Tank and The Howard Stern Show

<li><span class="a-list-item">
The Squatty Potty Original has 2 sizes that work perfectly with ANY standard (14"-15.5”) or comfort height (16""-18”) toilet. If you are a new squatter, the 7” is a great place to start and if you are limber or consider yourself an advanced squatter, a 9"" Squatty Potty will work best.

The Squatty Potty may feel different at first, but the body quickly adjusts and the new healthy way of eliminating quickly becomes second nature. For most people, the difference is immediate while for some it takes about a week to adjust, relax and get things moving.
