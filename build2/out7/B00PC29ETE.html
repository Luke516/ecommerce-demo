CONVENIENT FOR GPS NAVIGATION AND CALL- MPOW car phone mounts are essential to keep car drivers safe on the road by allowing drivers to keep both hands on the wheel and keep an eye on GPS navigation. The cell phone car mounts reduce the likelihood of accidents that can harm you and your passengers.

CD SLOT MOUNTS-Does your car CD player go unused? Make it functional again with MPOW phone holder. The base slips into your CD slot; then, it expands and locks into place, so your phone is always safe and stable. NOTE: Flip over to install for wider compatibility with different cars.

THREE SIDES GRIP DESIGN- MPOW car phone mount has three side grips to hold your device in place. A little button along the sides can be pushed which prompts the phone to pop out of the mount. What’s more, you get a 360-degree rotation for great viewing angles.

FITS 99% OF THE CD SLOTS: The car mount base won’t damage your CD slot, and can have its width customized for a secure fit by turning the knob, making the CD slot mount suitable for most vehicles with a standard CD player. You can still listen to CDs with the mount installed.
