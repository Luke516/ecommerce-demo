							Meets Carry On Standards - Refillable, reusable travel size bottles and 3-1-1 clear toiletry bag packaging are TSA approved and safe for carry-on/traveling through airplane. Our travel bottles are available in 3oz, 2oz and 1.25 ounce bottle sets.

<li><span class="a-list-item">
							Leak Proof Design - Drip free dispenser valve releases bottle contents only when the soft, flexible, squeezable silicon travel tube body is pressed. Each lid has 3 leakproof walls to protect your personal items in your bag from leaks or spills.
							
						</span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item">
							Made of superior quality that will last a lifetime of travel and adventure - The travel size containers' strong, sturdy design makes it a better alternative to disposable empty plastic containers and squeeze tube that simply don't last. Our travel bottle set is made of 100% BPA free food grade silicone, making it food safe.
							
						</span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item">
							Easy to Refill and Clean - Large opening of our silicone travel bottles makes refills and cleaning easy. Other plastic bottles are hard to fill and leak under changes in pressure. You can easily clean these toiletry containers by soaking in warm soapy water or by using the dishwasher (top rack only).
							
						</span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item">
							Easily identify contents of your bottle - Each travel bottle contains pre-printed ID labels (shampoo, conditioner, soap, sunscreen, lotion) to identify contents of the bottle. You also have the option to label it yourself using a marker.
