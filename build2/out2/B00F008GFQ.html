							MUST HAVE MAKEUP CASE STAPLE! Travel friendly, this black Flat Top Kabuki Makeup Brush isn't any ordinary brush. Buffing and blending, the dense synthetic bristles make your routine quicker, with better coverage that lasts longer. Pro Tip: For light to medium coverage, use a damp makeup sponge blender to stipple your base coverage, then blend with your buki brush!

							MULTI-TASKING BRUSH: Most commonly used with liquid foundation to set the canvas, this big flat top makeup brush also works great blending loose and pressed powder, primer, bb cream, and minerals to build coverage, setting your look, and concealing even the most problematic skin type (redness, uneven skin tones, large pores, acneic, dermatitis).

<li><span class="a-list-item">
							BRISTLE QUALITY IS KEY TO FLAWLESS COVERAGE: A premium quality foundation brush makes your foundation look more even, consistent, and blended, and lets you build coverage in problem areas. Our pro quality synthetic bristles are soft, yet just the right density to pick up and distribute liquid foundation evenly. Natural synthetic bristles use less product to achieve the desired look. Plus, they're cruelty free - WOOF!

							STOP USING YOUR FINGERS! Yes, please, stop applying foundation with your fingers. Your pores don't need any extra dirt and oils.
							
						</span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item">
							TOP RATED PROFESSIONAL QUALITY: COMPARES TO SIGMA, MAC, BARE MINERALS. Read the reviews; they speak for themselves. Purchase a single brush, or the set, which includes a blush brush, bronzer contouring brush, highlighter and under eye conceal brush, with an optional organizer case.
