							★ HYGIENIC – When using mouth trays, mouth guards, retainers, dentures or Invisalign, the storage can be just as important as the main purpose of the device. The only way to keep them clean and sanitized is by storing them in the sanitizer case. The sanitizer case keeps it away from exposure to dust, mold and germs. Keeping the case clean and free of germs increases the longevity of the product.
